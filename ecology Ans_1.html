        <h3>Ecology Ans_1</h3>
       
        <p> <strong>Question 1</strong> <br>
            Pestcides have heavy chemicals such as copper and mercury whhen they fall on soil and are taken up by
            nitrogen fixing bacteria they may die hence lowering soil ferility with consequent reduction of plant growth
        </p>
       
        <p> <strong>Qustion 2</strong> <br> <strong>Water Pollution.</strong> <br>
            • In most cases, chex,pical wastes from industries are discharged into water. <br>
            • Insecticides like DDT, and weed¬killers eventually get into the water and contaminate it. <br>
            • Oil and detergents also pollute water. <br>
            • Excess nitrates and phosphates from sewage and fertilisers cause overgrowth of algae and bacteria in
            water.(eutrophication.) <br>
        </p>
        
        <p> <strong>Air pollution:</strong> <br>
            • Smoke from industries and motor vehicles contains poisonous chemicals like carbon (II) oxide, carbon (IV)
            oxide, sulphur (IV) oxide and oxides of nitrogen. <br>
            • When sulphur (IV) oxide and oxides of nitrogen dissolve in rain, they fall as acid rain. <br>
            • Carbon particles in smoke coat the leaves of plants and hinder gaseous exchange and photosynthesis. <br>
            • The particles also form smog in the air. <br>
            • Burning of domestic waste releses carbon (iv) oxide and sulphur (iv) oxide in water. <br>
        </p>
        
        <p> <strong>Soil/Land pollution.</strong> <br>
            • Plastics and other man-made materials are biologically non-degradable i.e they are not acted upon by
            micro-organisms. <br>
            • Scrap metal and slag from mines also pollute land. <br>
            • Failure to rehabilitate mines and quarries also pollute land. <br>
        </p>
        
        <p> <strong>Effect to biotic</strong> <br>
            • Chemical pollutants e.g. nitrogen oxides, fluorides, mercury and lead cause physiological and metabolic
            disorders to humans and domestic animals. <br>
            • Some hydrocarbons as well as radioactive pollutants acts as mutagens (cause mutations) and carcinogens
            induce cancer. <br>
            • Radioactive pollutants like strontium, caesium and lithium are absorbed into body surface and cause harm
            to bone marrow and the thyroid gland. <br>
            • Communicable diseases like cholera are spread through water polluted with sewage. <br>
            • Thermal pollution result in death of some fish due to decreased oxygen in the water. <br>
            • Oil spills disrupt normal functioning of coastal ecosystems. <br>
            • Plant are affected by heavy smoke from the the vehicles which blocks the stomata. <br>
            • some chemicals kills nitrogen fixing micro-organisms <br>
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>Question 3</strong> <br>
        <strong>Niche</strong>
        A niche is the functional unit in the habitat.
        It includes not only the specific place in which an organism lives but also how the organisms. <br>
        <strong>Habitat</strong>  
        This is the place or "home" that an organism lives or is found,
        e.g., forest or grassland. <br>
        <strong>Dispersion</strong> 
        This is the distribution of individuals in the available space.
        Dispersion may be uniform as in maize plants in a plantation;
        random as in cactus plants in the savannah ecosystem or clumped together as in human population in cities. <br>
        <strong>Biomass</strong> 
        This is the mass of all the organisms in a given area.
        Ideally, it is the dry mass that should be compared. <br>
        <strong>Carrying capacity</strong> 
        This is the maximum sustainable density in a given area e.g. the number of herbivores a given area can support without
        overgrazing.</p>

        <p>
            <strong>Question one</strong> <br>
            a) Bacteria eg.cholera and typhoid <br>
            b) Protozoa e.g malaria and amoebic dysentery<br>
            c) parasitic worms eg. Ascaris lumbriocoides <br>
            d) Virus <br>
            e) Fungi <br>
            f) Nutritional deficiencies <br>
            g) Genetic <br>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Question two</strong> <br>
            Coronavirus/2019-nCOV <br>
            a) This is the name for a family of viruses that are mainly characterized by a positive-stranded RNA genome, and are
            bound
            in a membranous envelope. <br>
            b) <strong>Coronavirus</strong>This is the name for a family of viruses that are mainly characterized by a
            positive-stranded RNA genome, and are bound
            in a membranous envelope. In recent history, this virus family has been extensively studied, as this virus family
            was
            responsible for the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) outbreaks
            in
            2003 and 2012, respectively. Interestingly, coronaviruses are responsible for about a third of all common cold cases
            (rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, and others also cause the common cold). <br>
            <strong>2019-nCOV</strong> 2019-nCoV, is not similar to the more common coronaviruses, such as those that cause
            common colds. However, genetic
            analyses suggest this virus emerged from a virus related to SARS. There are ongoing investigations to learn more.
            <br>
            c) Through the air by coughing and sneezing <br>
            Close personal contact, such as touching or shaking hands <br>
            Touching an object or surface with the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes before washing your hands
            <br>
            In rare cases, fecal contamination <br>
            d) fever<br> difficulty breathing <br> cough <br> Almost all diagnosed cases have pneumonia; some develop kidney
            failure or
            other organ dysfunction.
            e) Regular hand-washing<br> Getting enough rest/fluids <br> Staying home when sick.

            <strong>Question three</strong> <br>
            <strong>Control of Air Pollution</strong> <br>
            • Use of lead-free petrol and low sulphur diesel in vehicles. <br>
            • Use of smokeless fuels e.g electricity or solar. <br>
            • Filtration of waste gases to remove harmful gases. <br>
            • Liquid dissolution of waste gases. <br>
            • In Kenya, factories are subjected to thorough audits to ensure that they do not pollute the environment. <br>
            • Factories should be erected far away from residential areas. <br>
            • Reduce volume or intensity of sound. <br>
            • Use of ear muffs. <br>
            • Vehicle exhaust systems should be fitted with catalytic oxidisers. <br>
            • Regular servicing of vehicles to ensure complete combustion of fuel. <br>
            <strong>Control of water Pollution</strong> <br>
            • Treatment of sewage. <br>
            • Treatment of industrial waste before discharge into water. <br>
            • Use of controlled amounts of agrochemicals. <br>
            • Organic farming and biological control. <br>
            • Avoid spillage of oils and other chemicals into water. <br>
            • Good water management. <br>
            • Stiff penalties for oil <br>
            • Use of Pseudomonas bacteria that naturally feed on oil and break it up. <br>
            <strong>Control of soil Pollution</strong> <br>
            • Addition of lime to farms to counteract the effect of agrochemicals. <br>
            • Recycling of solid waste. <br>
            • Compacting and incineration of solid waste. <br>
            • Use of biodegradable materials and chemicals. <br>
            • Good soil management to avoid soil erosion. <br>

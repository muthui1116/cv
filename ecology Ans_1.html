        <p><strong>Question 1</strong><br>(a) Lungs have numerous alveoli to increase S.A for diffusion of gases;
            alveoli have thin membrane which minimizes
            resistance against gases; blood flowing in the capillaries contains less oxygen and more C02 since it is
            from the body
            tissue; alveoli are supplied with air through bronchioles which link them to the trachea; alveoli are
            supplied with many
            capillaries containing blood to transport gases; air in the alveoli contain more oxygen and combine with
            haemoglobin,
            forming oxyhaemoglobin; C02 diffuses out of the blood into the alveoli ;from where it is exhaled;(8marks)
            <br>(b) Internal intercostal muscles contracts and external intercostal muscles relax; The ribcage moves
            downwards and
            inwards; diaphragm muscles relax; diaphragm assumes its dome-shaped; volume in the thoracic cavity
            decreases; resulting
            in increase in lung volume, pressure in the lung increases; air is then forced out of the lungs; (8marks)
            <br>(c) Thin membrane and epithelial lining for easy diffusion of respiratory gases;
            Highly folded surfaces to provide large surface area for efficient diffusion of gases;
            Moist surfaces for dissolving the gases before they diffuse;
            Highly vascularized surface for efficient transport of gases to maintain high concentration gradient
            (4 marks)
        </p>
        <p><strong>Question 2</strong><br>Nitrogen fixation; is the process of converting Nitrogen to Nitrates; and is
            done through three means. <br>
            During thunderstorm/ lightning energy combines, atmospheric Nitrogen gas with oxygen to form oxides of
            nitrogen; which
            dissolve in water to form nitric acid and nitrous acid; acid combines with chemical compounds to form
            nitrates which are
            absorbed by plants; <br>
            Symbiotic bacteria such as Rhizobium; which are found in root nodules of leguminous plants; fix free
            nitrogen to
            nitrates; <br>
            Free living bacteria e.g clostridium, Azotobacter, fix nitrogen; and also non-bacteria fixers e.g Nostac
            algae /
            chlorella/ anabaena, fix nitrogen to ammonia;
            Nitrification; is the process of oxidizing ammonium compounds or nitrites to nitrates; <br>
            Ammonia is oxidized into nitrites by nitrifying bacteria e.g nitrosomonas and nitrococcus; Nitrites are
            converted into
            nitrates b nitrifying bacteria e.g nitrobacter;
            Absorption and assimilation; Nitrates is then absorbed by the plants; plants use nitrates to form plant
            proteins;
            animals feed on plants and convert plant protein into animal protein; <br>
            Death and decomposition; plants and animals die and are decomposed by saprophytic bacteria and fungi;
            Decomposition
            release ammonia which is converted to nitrites the to nitrates; <br>
            Denitrification; Process in which nitrates are reduced into nitrites or atmospheric Nitrogen; This is done
            by
            denitrifying bacteria such as pseudomonas denitrificans and Thiobacillus denitrificans; they utilize oxygen
            released to
            carry out respiration ;<br>

            <strong>Question one</strong> <br>
            a) Bacteria eg.cholera and typhoid <br>
            b) Protozoa e.g malaria and amoebic dysentery<br>
            c) parasitic worms eg. Ascaris lumbriocoides <br>
            d) Virus <br>

            <strong>Question two</strong> <br>
            Coronavirus/2019-nCOV <br>
            a) This is the name for a family of viruses that are mainly characterized by a positive-stranded RNA genome,
            and are
            bound
            in a membranous envelope. <br>
            b) <strong>Coronavirus</strong>This is the name for a family of viruses that are mainly characterized by a
            positive-stranded RNA genome, and are bound
            in a membranous envelope. In recent history, this virus family has been extensively studied, as this virus
            family
            was
            responsible for the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome)
            outbreaks
            in
            2003 and 2012, respectively. Interestingly, coronaviruses are responsible for about a third of all common
            cold cases
            (rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, and others also cause the common cold). <br>
            <strong>2019-nCOV</strong> 2019-nCoV, is not similar to the more common coronaviruses, such as those that
            cause
            common colds. However, genetic
            analyses suggest this virus emerged from a virus related to SARS. There are ongoing investigations to learn
            more.
            <br>
            c) Through the air by coughing and sneezing <br>
            Close personal contact, such as touching or shaking hands <br>
            Touching an object or surface with the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes before washing
            your hands
            <br>
            In rare cases, fecal contamination <br>
            d) fever<br> difficulty breathing <br> cough <br> Almost all diagnosed cases have pneumonia; some develop
            kidney
            failure or
            other organ dysfunction.
            e) Regular hand-washing<br> Getting enough rest/fluids <br> Staying home when sick.

            <strong>Question three</strong> <br>
            <strong>Control of Air Pollution</strong> <br>
            • Use of lead-free petrol and low sulphur diesel in vehicles. <br>
            • Use of smokeless fuels e.g electricity or solar. <br>
            • Filtration of waste gases to remove harmful gases. <br>
            • Liquid dissolution of waste gases. <br>
            • In Kenya, factories are subjected to thorough audits to ensure that they do not pollute the environment.
            <br>
            • Factories should be erected far away from residential areas. <br>
            • Reduce volume or intensity of sound. <br>
            • Use of ear muffs. <br>
            • Vehicle exhaust systems should be fitted with catalytic oxidisers. <br>
            • Regular servicing of vehicles to ensure complete combustion of fuel. <br>
            <strong>Control of water Pollution</strong> <br>
            • Treatment of sewage. <br>
            • Treatment of industrial waste before discharge into water. <br>
            • Use of controlled amounts of agrochemicals. <br>
            • Organic farming and biological control. <br>
            • Avoid spillage of oils and other chemicals into water. <br>
            • Good water management. <br>

        <p> <strong>Question 1</strong> <br> Pestcides have heavy chemicals such as copper and mercury whhen they fall
            on soil and are taken up by
            nitrogen fixing bacteria they may die hence lowering soil ferility with consequent reduction of plant growth
        </p>
        <p> <strong>Qustion 2</strong> <br> <strong>Water Pollution.</strong> <br>
            • In most cases, chex,pical wastes from industries are discharged into water. <br>
            • Insecticides like DDT, and weed¬killers eventually get into the water and contaminate it. <br>
            • Oil and detergents also pollute water. <br>
            • Excess nitrates and phosphates from sewage and fertilisers cause overgrowth of algae and bacteria in
            water.(eutrophication.) <br>
        </p>
        <p> <strong>Air pollution:</strong> <br>
            • Smoke from industries and motor vehicles contains poisonous chemicals like carbon (II) oxide, carbon (IV)
            oxide, sulphur (IV) oxide and oxides of nitrogen. <br>
            • When sulphur (IV) oxide and oxides of nitrogen dissolve in rain, they fall as acid rain. <br>
            • Carbon particles in smoke coat the leaves of plants and hinder gaseous exchange and photosynthesis. <br>
            • The particles also form smog in the air. <br>
            • Burning of domestic waste releses carbon (iv) oxide and sulphur (iv) oxide in water. <br>
        </p>
        <p> <strong>Soil/Land pollution.</strong> <br>
            • Plastics and other man-made materials are biologically non-degradable i.e they are not acted upon by
            micro-organisms. <br>
            • Scrap metal and slag from mines also pollute land. <br>
            • Failure to rehabilitate mines and quarries also pollute land. <br>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Effect to biotic</strong><br>
            • Chemical pollutants e.g. nitrogen oxides, fluorides, mercury and lead cause physiological and metabolic
            disorders to humans and domestic animals. <br>
            • Some hydrocarbons as well as radioactive pollutants acts as mutagens (cause mutations) and carcinogens
            induce cancer. <br>
            • Radioactive pollutants like strontium, caesium and lithium are absorbed into body surface and cause harm
            to bone marrow and the thyroid gland. <br>
            • Communicable diseases like cholera are spread through water polluted with sewage. <br>
            • Thermal pollution result in death of some fish due to decreased oxygen in the water. <br>
            • Oil spills disrupt normal functioning of coastal ecosystems. <br>
            • Plant are affected by heavy smoke from the the vehicles which blocks the stomata. <br>
            • some chemicals kills nitrogen fixing micro-organisms <br>

        </p>
        <p> <strong>Question 3</strong> <br> <strong>Niche</strong>
            A niche is the functional unit in the habitat.
            It includes not only the specific place in which an organism lives but also how the organisms. <br>
            <strong>Habitat</strong>
            This is the place or "home" that an organism lives or is found,
            e.g., forest or grassland. <br>
            <strong>Dispersion</strong>
            This is the distribution of individuals in the available space.
            Dispersion may be uniform as in maize plants in a plantation;
            random as in cactus plants in the savannah ecosystem or clumped together as in human population in cities.
            <br>
            <strong>Biomass</strong>
            This is the mass of all the organisms in a given area.
            Ideally, it is the dry mass that should be compared. <br>
            <strong>Carrying capacity</strong>
            This is the maximum sustainable density in a given area e.g. the number of herbivores a given area can
            support without
            overgrazing.

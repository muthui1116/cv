         <h4>Question 1</h4>
        <p>Pestcides have heavy chemicals such as copper and mercury when they fall on soil and are taken up by
            nitrogen fixing bacteria they may die hence lowering soil ferility with consequent reduction of plant growth
        </p>
        <h4>Qustion 2</h4>
        <p> <strong>Water Pollution.</strong> <br>
            • In most cases, chex,pical wastes from industries are discharged into water. <br>
            • Insecticides like DDT, and weed¬killers eventually get into the water and contaminate it. <br>
            • Oil and detergents also pollute water. <br>
            • Excess nitrates and phosphates from sewage and fertilisers cause overgrowth of algae and bacteria in
            water.(eutrophication.) <br>
        </p>
        <p> <strong>Air pollution:</strong> <br>
            • Smoke from industries and motor vehicles contains poisonous chemicals like carbon (II) oxide, carbon (IV)
            oxide, sulphur (IV) oxide and oxides of nitrogen. <br>
            • When sulphur (IV) oxide and oxides of nitrogen dissolve in rain, they fall as acid rain. <br>
            • Carbon particles in smoke coat the leaves of plants and hinder gaseous exchange and photosynthesis. <br>
            • The particles also form smog in the air. <br>
            • Burning of domestic waste releses carbon (iv) oxide and sulphur (iv) oxide in water. <br>
        </p>
        <p> <strong>Soil/Land pollution.</strong> <br>
            • Plastics and other man-made materials are biologically non-degradable i.e they are not acted upon by
            micro-organisms. <br>
            • Scrap metal and slag from mines also pollute land. <br>
            • Failure to rehabilitate mines and quarries also pollute land. <br>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Effect to biotic</strong><br>
            • Chemical pollutants e.g. nitrogen oxides, fluorides, mercury and lead cause physiological and metabolic
            disorders to humans and domestic animals. <br>
            • Some hydrocarbons as well as radioactive pollutants acts as mutagens (cause mutations) and carcinogens
            induce cancer. <br>
            • Radioactive pollutants like strontium, caesium and lithium are absorbed into body surface and cause harm
            to bone marrow and the thyroid gland. <br>
            • Communicable diseases like cholera are spread through water polluted with sewage. <br>
            • Thermal pollution result in death of some fish due to decreased oxygen in the water. <br>
            • Oil spills disrupt normal functioning of coastal ecosystems. <br>
            • Plant are affected by heavy smoke from the the vehicles which blocks the stomata. <br>
            • some chemicals kills nitrogen fixing micro-organisms <br>

        </p>
        <h4>Question 3</h4>
        <p><strong>Niche</strong>
        A niche is the functional unit in the habitat.
        It includes not only the specific place in which an organism lives but also how the organisms. <br>
         <strong>Habitat</strong>  
        This is the place or "home" that an organism lives or is found,
        e.g., forest or grassland. <br>
         <strong>Dispersion</strong> 
        This is the distribution of individuals in the available space.
        Dispersion may be uniform as in maize plants in a plantation;
        random as in cactus plants in the savannah ecosystem or clumped together as in human population in cities. <br>
        <strong>Biomass</strong> 
        This is the mass of all the organisms in a given area.
        Ideally, it is the dry mass that should be compared. <br>
        <strong>Carrying capacity</strong> 
        This is the maximum sustainable density in a given area e.g. the number of herbivores a given area can support without
        overgrazing.

     1.	a)	 It is a change in body form of an organism in the course of its life cycle from egg to 	adult forms. <br>
  b) Enable an organism to grow in size and complexity. <br>
      Enable organism to occupy different habitats/ecological niches. <br>
      Pupal stage enables organisms go through unfavourable conditions increasing chances of
      survival. <br>
  4.	i) Ribosomes rej. ribosome <br>
  ii) Golgi bodies/apparatus <br>
  8.	a) – Are long to increase surface area for absorption of water and mineral salts <br>
  -	Have numerous mitochondria to supply energy (for active uptake of minerals); <br>
  -	Have thin walls for faster movement of substances; <br>
  -	Have large sap vacuole with solutes for steep concentration gradient; <br>
    b) High humidity reduces concentration gradient of water vapour between the intercellular <br>
      air spaces of the leaves and atmosphere; hence reducing rate of transpiration; <br>
  10.	a) To hold the slide firmly on the stage; <br>
  b) Raises or lowers the body tube for longer distance to bring the image into focus; <br>
  12.	a) Positive geotropism <br>
    b) – High concentration of auxins promotes faster growth on the lower side of the stem than
        the upper side; <br>
                -High concentration of auxins on the upper side of the root promotes faster growth; <br>
  15.	Y-Chromosome – Tuft of hairs sprouting from pinna; premature bladness; rej. baldness alone <br>
  X-Chromosome – colour blindness/haemnophillia; <br>

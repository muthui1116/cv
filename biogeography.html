        <p>Biogeography is a discipline that contain the two subjects in secondary schools, Biology and Geography: <br> 1. Biology is a word that is derived from two Greek words bios and logos.<br>a) Bios means life<br>b) Logos
            means knowledge<br>Therefore biology can be defined as branch of science that deals with the study of living
            things. The aim of biology
            is to explain the living world in terms of scientific principles. Living things interacts with non-living
            things in their physical environment. Therefore, the study of biology has been explained to the study of
            non- living things and the role
            of human beings in shaping their environment .</p>
        <p>2. Geography is a word that was derived from two Greek words Geo and Graphein.<br>a)Geo which means earth
            and,<br>b)Graphein which means to write, to draw; write about or describe the earth.<br>Geography is study
            of description of the
            distribution of the natural features of the earth and their inter-relationship of various phenomena on the
            earth surface due to human activities and how they affects man.

        <p>At higher learning institutions such as colleges and universities biogeography has got broader
            definition.<br> This is due to complexity of this discipline therefore it is very difficult to coin a single
            definition about Biogeography.<br> Below
            are some of the biogeography definitions used in universities.<br></p>
        <p><strong><em>You are getting this because you are on the best platform for learning.</em></strong> <br> Biogeography is the study of the spatial patterns of biological diversity and its causes, both in the present
            and in the past. Bio-geographers’ synthesize information from a very broad range of fields, including
            ecology, evolution, paleontology,
            and climatology. It is a branch of geography that studies the past and present distribution of the world's
            many species. It is usually considered to be a part of physical geography as it often relates to the
            examination of the physical
            environment and how it affects species and shaped their distribution across space. Biogeography has strong
            ties to biology, ecology, evolution studies, climatology, and soil science. Biogeography is a branch of
            natural sciences that describes the
            distribution and abundance of living organisms. It encompasses patterns and processes that operate across a
            wide range of spatial and temporal scales and therefore attempts to answer different questions such as
            ‘where do living organisms occur,
            why do they occur where they occur, how many are they and what do they do?’ in other words biogeography
            deals with identification of different patterns of distribution of organisms on or beneath the earth’s
            surface.

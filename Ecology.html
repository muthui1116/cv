  <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
  <p>Introduction Ecology is derived from two words.<br> ECO or oikos and logos.<br> ECO means house or place to live in and logos means study of.<br> Therefore ecology is the study of the inter-relationships of organisms to each other and to their
    environment.<br> To bring out this let us look at this illustration. For a cabbage to grow it requires light, rainfall among other factors. Worms rely on cabbages for survival. Therefore there exist a relationship between a cabbage, worm and the
    weather. </p>
  <p>Ecology is subdivided in to two main branches, that is, <em>synecology</em> and <em>autecology.</em><br>
    Synecology is the study of different species living and interacting in the same ecosystem e.g. wild beasts, warthogs, zebras and termites living in the same ecosystem.<br>
    Autecology involves the study of a single species or individual group of organisms, for example the wildebeest in Maasai Mara.

  <h3>Terms used in Ecology</h3>
  <p> Some of the terms that are used in ecology include: <br>
    <strong>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Biosphere</li>
        <li>Habitat</li>
        <li>Niche</li>
        <li>Population</li>
        <li>Community</li>
        <li>Ecosystem</li>
        <li>Carrying capacity.</li>
      </ol>
    </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Biosphere (Ecosphere)</strong>  It is the part of the earth and atmosphere inhabited by living organisms</p>
    <p><strong>Habitat</strong>
 This is the physical location that an organism lives in with a particular set of conditions. <br> Examples are a fish living in a pond, a grasshopper in a field, and monkeys in a forest. <br> The pond, the field and forest are habitats. <br> Some habitats are formed of land therefore referred to as terrestrial or can be formed of water therefore referred to as aquatic.

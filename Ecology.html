  <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
  <p>Introduction Ecology is derived from two words.<br> ECO or oikos and logos.<br> ECO means house or place to live in and logos means study of.<br> Therefore ecology is the study of the inter-relationships of organisms to each other and to their
    environment.<br> To bring out this let us look at this illustration. For a cabbage to grow it requires light, rainfall among other factors. Worms rely on cabbages for survival. Therefore there exist a relationship between a cabbage, worm and the
    weather. </p>
  <p>Ecology is subdivided in to two main branches, that is, <em>synecology</em> and <em>autecology.</em><br>
    Synecology is the study of different species living and interacting in the same ecosystem e.g. wild beasts, warthogs, zebras and termites living in the same ecosystem.<br>
    Autecology involves the study of a single species or individual group of organisms, for example the wildebeest in Maasai Mara.
  </p>
  <h3>Terms used in Ecology</h3>
  <p> Some of the terms that are used in ecology include: <br>
    <strong>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Biosphere</li>
        <li>Habitat</li>
        <li>Niche</li>
        <li>Population</li>
        <li>Community</li>
        <li>Ecosystem</li>
        <li>Carrying capacity.</li>
      </ol>
    </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Biosphere (Ecosphere)</strong> <br>  It is the part of the earth and atmosphere inhabited by living organisms</p>
    <p><strong>Habitat</strong> <br>
 This is the physical location that an organism lives in with a particular set of conditions. <br> Examples are a fish living in a pond, a grasshopper in a field, and monkeys in a forest. <br> The pond, the field and forest are habitats. <br> Some habitats are formed of land therefore referred to as terrestrial or can be formed of water therefore referred to as aquatic.
</p>
<p><strong>Niche</strong> <br>
Describes where an organism lives and how it lives. This includes the position that an organism occupies in a habitat such as physical space and the role the organism plays in the habitat in terms of feeding relationships and interactions with other species.
For example, buffaloes, zebras and egrets can live in the same habitat but each organism is playing a different role. Giraffes are browsers, zebras, buffaloes and gazelles are grazers, while the egrets are  commensals.</p>
<p> <strong>Population </strong> <br>
Refers to the total number of a particular species of organisms living in a particular habitat at a particular time.
For example:  The number of flamingos at Lake Nakuru is approximately 250,000.
Example two: The population of people in Kibera as per 2009 census is approximately 170,070.</p>
<p><strong>Community</strong> <br>
This refers to all the organisms of different species that live within the same habitat. For example, in an old log of wood you can find termites, mushrooms, caterpillars, garden worms and many other organisms living together though they belong to different species.  A community changes gradually from few organisms to many organisms. The photograph shows an example of a community.</p>
<p><strong>Ecosystem </strong> <br>
An ecosystem is a unit comprised of several habitats and their communities of organisms living together in a self sustaining environment. Play the video clip below to see an example of an ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Carrying capacity</strong> <br>
This is the maximum population of a species that a particular habitat can support indefinitely under a given set of environmental conditions without depletion of resources in that habitat.
Photograph one shows an area inhabited by few organisms that the resources can sustain while in photograph two, there are very many organisms that the available resources cannot sustain and therefore the resources have been depleted.</p>
<h3>Factors in an ecosystem.</h3>
 <p>These factors are divided into two groups namely:
   <ol>
     <li>Abiotic factors </li>
     <li>Biotic factors</li>
   </ol>
	</p>
	<h3>Abiotic factors</h3>
<p>Abiotic factors refers to all the non-living environmental factors which affect the distribution of organisms in an ecosystem. </p>
	<p><strong>Light</strong> <br>
The sun is the main source of energy for all life on earth. Green plants and photosynthetic bacteria need light energy to manufacture food.  Animals depend on plants for food either directly or indirectly. Light affects growth and distribution of plants e.g. a forest that has a thick canopy there is limited undergrowth, but in a well light forest i.e. without a thick canopy there is thick undergrowth. Light intensity is measured by a photographic light meter while light penetration in water is measured using a seechi disc. </p>
<p><strong>Temperature</strong> <br>
Biochemical processes in most organisms function efficiently within a narrow range of temperature. This therefore affects the distribution of organisms in a habitat. Organisms must develop physiological and behavioral adaptations to cope with extreme temperatures. For example, the bear has thick fur to cope with extremes of low temperatures in the polar regions.  Air temperature is measured by a thermometer while air temperature range is measured by the maximum and minimum thermometer.</p>

	<p><strong>Atmospheric pressure.</strong><br> 
The atmosphere exerts pressure on the earth. This varies with altitude and determines the relative concentration of oxygen needed for respiration and carbon (IV) oxide for photosynthesis. This affects the distribution of organisms in a habitat. Decrease in atmospheric pressure increases the rate of transpiration and therefore the need to conserve water by plants. The illustration shows the variation of oxygen and carbon IV oxide concentration with attitude and the distribution of organisms. Atmospheric pressure is measured using a barometer.

	<p><strong>Humidity</strong><br>
Humidity refers to the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere. When humidity is high there is much water vapour in the atmosphere creating fog and mist e.g. in the Limuru area, but when it is low there is less water vapour in the atmosphere like in the desert where the sky is clear. This in turn affects the distribution of organisms on earth. Humidity is measured using a wet and dry bulb hygrometer. </p>

<p><strong>Wind</strong><br>
Wind is moving air. It increases the rate of water loss from organisms therefore affecting their body.  It carries water vapour to the upper parts of the atmosphere where it condenses and precipitates as rain. In desert areas wind aids in formation of sand dunes. Stable sand dunes may become habitats for growth of desert plants.
Wind also causes wave formation in lakes and oceans, which enhances aeration of water in these water bodies.
Trees growing in areas experiencing strong winds may have stunted and distorted growth. Wind also disperses spores and seeds and influence dispersal.</p>

<h3>Biotic factors<h3>
<p>These are factors in an organism's environment that arise from other living organisms. These factors may affect an organism in many ways. For example: competition, predation, parasitism and symbiosis.<p/>

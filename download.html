<h3>RESPIRATION</h3>
    All living organisms require a constant supply of energy. This energy is obtained from food substance that are either taken in or manufactured during photosynthesis. To release this energy food substances such as <strong>carbohydrates</strong> and <strong>fats</strong> are broken down in the cells in a series of enzymes controlled reactions. <br>
Therefore, <u><em>Respiration</em></u> can be defined as <strong>the process whereby food substances are chemically broken down within all living cell to release energy necessary for body activities, carbon (iv) oxide and water or alcohol </strong>. During respiration energy is released in small amounts gradually in stages. This prevent cells from burning up: If all the energy in the food were to be released all at once the cells would be destroyed.</P>

<font size="5"><strrong>Importance of Respiration</strrong></font> <br>
<u>Respiration  produces energy that is used to carry out various activities in the body. The  activities include;</u><br>
•	Reproduction <br />
•	Growth and development <br>
•	Repair  of worn out tissues <br>
•	Muscle  contractions to bring about various movements. <br>
•	Conduction of nerve impulses <br>
•	Secretion of enzymes <br>
•	Functioning of the body organs such as kidneys, heart and brain. <br> </p>

 <font size='4'><em> <strong>NB: Respiration should not be confused with gaseous exchange—Respiration is a chemical process taking place inside living cells. Gaseous exchange is a pure physical process that take place on respiratory surfaces.</strong> </em>
